# Possible performance optimizations

* Use getShmImage extension for X11 server.
* TODO: Use double buffering when creating the texture, s.t. we do not
  need to wait for OpenGL to finish drawing a frame before updating to
  a new one?
  Fetch xImage in separate thread -> push into pipeline for main
  thread with ptr to preexisting texture?
* Use compositeoverlaywindow for masking:
   Window overlay_window = XCompositeGetOverlayWindow(display, root);
   Make GLFW Window with proper size and location child of overlay_window
   via reparenting.
   DONE?!
    -- overlay <- xCompositeGetOverlayWindow dp root
    -- xCompositeRedirectWindow dp w CompositeRedirectAutomatic
    -- mapWindow dp overlay
    -- reparentWindow dp meW overlay 0 0

# Notes
* NOTE: Need to set the events we are interested in ON the window we are
  listening on!
* NOTE: A RUNNING compositemanager is ALSO required! MAYBE?
* zPixmap required!
